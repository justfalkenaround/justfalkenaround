# 👋 Falken Brown

### Founder @ Inexstinct • Engineer • Curious Builder

I started **Inexstinct** to explore how research and development can help us **achieve more**—through experimentation, learning, and pushing ideas into practice.  

This GitHub isn’t about polished products. It’s where I keep side projects, prototypes, and experiments. Some work, some break, all teach me something.  
Each project here reflects a different step in my **educational journey as a builder**.
